Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing detailed instructions for every task, ML systems use algorithms to analyze data, recognize patterns, and improve performance over time. The main idea is that the system “learns” from examples — for instance, a model trained on thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs can later identify new images correctly.

ML can be broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data with known outcomes (e.g., predicting house prices). Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns or groupings (e.g., customer segmentation). Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties (e.g., game-playing AI). Today, machine learning is widely applied in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, recommendation systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, making it a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
